Welcome to this blog! This is a Jekyll-based clone inspired by Vitalik Buterin's personal blog, with a modern design and full dark mode support.

## Key Features

This blog includes several important features that make it perfect for publishing technical content:

### 1. **Light & Dark Mode Toggle**
You can toggle between light and dark themes using the button in the navigation bar. Your preference is automatically saved and persists across page loads.

- **Light Mode**: Clean white background with excellent readability
- **Dark Mode**: Pure black background with Vitalik's signature green text (#3EAF4A)

### 2. **Responsive Design**
The blog adapts perfectly to any screen size, from large desktop monitors to small mobile devices. Navigation and content automatically adjust for optimal viewing.

### 3. **Markdown-Based Posts**
Posts are written in Markdown format, making them easy to write and maintain. The Jekyll engine automatically converts them to beautiful HTML.

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply add a new Markdown file to the `_posts/` directory with the following format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md
```

Make sure each post includes YAML frontmatter at the top:

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is perfect for bloggers because:

- **No Database Required**: Posts are stored as Markdown files in version control
- **GitHub Pages Native**: Automatic deployment with every git push
- **Speed**: Static HTML generation means lightning-fast page loads
- **Security**: No backend vulnerabilities or database attacks
- **Simplicity**: Minimal configuration needed to get started

## Try Dark Mode

Notice how you can toggle the theme using the icon in the top navigation? Try clicking it now to switch to dark mode. The theme preference is stored locally in your browser.

## Next Steps

1. Edit your site configuration in `_config.yml`
2. Create your own posts in the `_posts/` directory
3. Customize the styling in `assets/css/style.css`
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages for free hosting

Enjoy blogging!
