## Departure: Day Zero

The countdown had been running for six years before Mara Solano ever heard her name attached to it.

She found out the same way everyone else did — a push notification on a Tuesday morning, between a weather alert and a grocery delivery confirmation. The subject line read: *CREW SELECTION CONFIRMED — ARES LONGFALL MISSION*. Her coffee went cold before she remembered to drink it.

Longfall was not the flashy mission. The flashy mission was Ares Prime, the one with the live broadcast launch, the celebrity endorsements, the children waving flags at Cape Canaveral. Longfall was the other one. The one that went further. The one with the longer silence between transmissions. The one the agency described, in its internal documents, as *optimistically survivable*.

Mara had applied because she believed in the work. She had not entirely expected to be selected.

Three months later she was strapped into a seat on the *Vespera*, watching Earth shrink in the porthole beside her left shoulder. She did not cry. She had cried the night before, alone in her quarters at the training facility, so that she would not have to cry now. Planning ahead was a core competency for deep space personnel.

## Transit: Month Two

They were four aboard the *Vespera*: Mara, Commander Ilya Petrov, mission specialist Dr. Chidinma Okafor, and engineer Tomás Delgado.

The ship was not large. It was not meant to be large. Every gram launched into orbit cost money that could have funded three hospitals or half a school, and space agencies had long since stopped pretending otherwise. So the *Vespera*'s interior was efficient, intentional, and exactly three degrees too cold at all times because the heating calibration had never been quite right since the third system test.

They ate from sealed packets, slept in rotation, and exercised for two mandatory hours a day on equipment that folded into the wall when not in use. The exercise was non-negotiable. Bone density in microgravity did not maintain itself out of good manners.

What surprised Mara was how comfortable it became. Not pleasant, exactly. But known. The sounds of the ship became a language she understood without thinking: the periodic clunk of the attitude thrusters, the low cycling hum of the air processors, the specific creak Tomás had named *Gerald* that came from a joint in the port bulkhead whenever the temperature differential passed a certain threshold.

At night — ship's night, which was arbitrary but respected — she would float beside her porthole and watch the stars. They did not twinkle out here. Without atmosphere they were hard and constant, scattered so densely that the darkness between them seemed like the afterthought.

She found it peaceful in a way that she struggled to transmit back to Earth in her scheduled communications. *It is very quiet here* felt insufficient. *I feel like I finally understand what rest means* felt too intimate. She settled, most nights, for *mission is proceeding normally. Crew morale is good.*

Both things were true.

## Arrival: Month Seven

The approach to Kepler Station took eleven days of careful deceleration. From a distance, the station looked like a dropped handful of silver coins, slowly spinning against the dark. Up close it was the size of a small town, a network of interconnected modules and habitat rings and docking arms that had been assembled over twelve years by crews who never shared the same launch window.

Mara's job at Kepler was atmospheric spectroscopy. She was looking for biosignatures — chemical traces in the thin envelopes of gas surrounding the three rocky worlds in the system's habitable zone. The work required patience and precise instrumentation and the ability to feel genuinely excited about parts-per-billion variations in methane concentrations.

She was very good at it. She had always been good at finding signal in noise.

Six weeks into her rotation, she found something.

## The Signal: Week Eight

It was a methane spike in the northern mesosphere of KH-3, the second rock in the belt. Not dramatic. Not the screaming trumpet blast of first contact that science fiction had promised. It was a number, and then a second number, and then a graph that looked wrong in a specific, non-random way that made Mara's hands go very still above her keyboard.

She checked her calibration. She ran the data through a second reduction pipeline. She asked Chidinma to look at it without telling her what she was looking for.

Chidinma looked at the graph for a long time. Then she said, very quietly: "That's seasonal."

Methane spikes that tracked a planetary season were consistent with biological metabolism. Not proof. Not even close to proof. But consistent with.

The transmission to Earth took forty-three minutes at the speed of light. The reply took forty-three more. In those eighty-six minutes, Mara sat in the observation bay and looked at KH-3 through the main viewport — a rust-brown disc, cloud-streaked, unhurried in its orbit — and thought about everything that word *consistent* might and might not mean.

The reply from mission control was careful and measured and asked for seventeen additional data products. She started generating them before she finished reading.

## Transit Home: Month Nineteen

The return trip was different.

Same ship. Same cold. Same creak from Gerald in the port bulkhead. But the data was with them now, archived across three redundant storage systems, and in the evenings Mara would pull it up and look at it again even though she had long since memorized every value.

Ilya found her at it one night, floating beside his bunk, reading her work on a tablet with the screen dimmed to the lowest setting.

*You should sleep,* he said.

*I know,* she said.

He pushed off from the bulkhead and drifted over to look at the graph. He was not a biologist or a chemist. He was a pilot and a commander and a man who had spent more of his adult life off Earth than on it. He looked at the data for a moment and then said: *Is it real?*

She had thought about how to answer this question for eleven months. She had precise scientific language for the uncertainty, the confidence intervals, the alternative abiotic explanations that could not yet be ruled out.

What she said was: *I think so.*

He nodded. He did not say anything else. He pushed back to his bunk and turned off his light.

Mara floated there for another hour in the dark, watching the stars that did not twinkle, thinking about a rust-brown planet forty-three light-minutes away where something might, against all the vast indifferent silence of the universe, be alive.

## Postscript: Earth, Three Years Later

The paper ran to sixty-two pages. The peer review took fourteen months. The press conference was smaller than the Ares Prime launch, but the room was quieter, and the questions took longer to ask, because everyone in it understood that they were participating in a sentence that had no definite end yet.

Mara answered every question carefully.

On the walk back from the podium, Chidinma fell into step beside her and said: *How does it feel?*

Mara thought about the *Vespera* and the cold and Gerald and the hard unblinking stars and the graph that looked wrong in a specific, non-random way.

*Incomplete,* she said. *It feels incomplete.*

She was already thinking about the follow-up mission.
