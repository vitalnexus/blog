Some games grab you for a weekend. Astroneer grabbed me for 250+ hours and I'm still not done.

## What Is It

Astroneer is a space exploration sandbox by System Era Softworks. You land on an alien planet with nothing but a small shelter and a terrain tool, and from there you dig, build, explore, and eventually colonize an entire solar system. No combat. No enemies trying to murder you every five seconds. Just you, the terrain, and an absolutely enormous universe to make your own.

## Why It Works

The core loop is deceptively simple: gather resources, research new tech, build bigger and better bases, then pack up and fly to the next planet to do it all over again. But each planet has its own atmosphere, resources, hazards, and visual identity. The progression from "I can barely survive on the surface" to "I have a network of bases across seven planets" is one of the most satisfying arcs I've experienced in a sandbox game.

The terrain deformation system is genuinely impressive. You can dig tunnels to the planet's core, flatten mountains, build bridges over chasms. The world feels truly malleable in a way most games only pretend to offer.

## Co-op

Astroneer shines even brighter in co-op. Having a friend (or three) exploring alongside you turns every expedition into a story. We've had moments where someone got lost in a cave system, someone else drove a rover off a cliff, and someone accidentally launched a shuttle without the rest of the crew. Those unscripted moments are what make this game memorable.

## The Nitpicks

The learning curve is gentle but the game does not hold your hand with explanations. You'll spend some time figuring out which widget plugs into which platform. Late-game resource grinding can get repetitive -- once you know what you need, it's just a matter of going to get it. And the framerate can dip when your bases get large and complex.

## The Verdict

250+ hours. All planets completed. All achievements unlocked. And I'd still go back to start a new save.

Astroneer is one of those rare games that's exactly what it wants to be, with no pretense and no filler. If you like exploration, building, and the idea of making an entire solar system your playground, this is the one.

**10 / 10** -- Would dig to the center of the planet again.
