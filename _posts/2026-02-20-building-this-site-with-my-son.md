Let me tell you about the most humbling experience of my recent life: sitting next to my son while he built this entire website using AI tools, and realizing I was mostly just furniture.

## The Setup

I had this idea. Simple enough -- build a personal blog. Space theme, dark mode, the works. I've been gaming for over a decade, streaming on YouTube, collecting achievements on Steam. I figured it was time to have a corner of the internet that wasn't just a profile page someone else designed.

So my son and I sat down to build it.

## The Reality

Here's what I actually contributed to this project:

1. I sat there
2. I watched
3. My mouth hung open
4. I laughed
5. I cackled
6. I called him a dick

That's it. That's my contribution. He's over there feeding prompts to AI, watching code materialize out of thin air, and I'm sitting next to him looking like someone just showed a caveman a lighter.

## The Frustration is Real

Don't get me wrong -- AI tools are incredible. They're also incredibly frustrating. You ask for one thing and get three things you didn't ask for. You ask it to fix a bug and it introduces two more. You spend twenty minutes arguing with a language model about whether a div should have a border or not.

My son handled it with the patience of someone who grew up with this stuff. I handled it by staring at the screen and periodically making noises of disbelief.

## What Got Built

Look around. This whole site -- the animated black hole spinning in the background, the green-on-black cave dweller aesthetic, the gaming hub pulling stats from my actual Steam profile, the fully playable Defender and Steve's Gate games -- all of it was assembled while I sat there providing what I can only describe as "emotional support."

My only real design input was "make it dark, make it green, I don't like the light because I spend all my time cave dwelling." And you know what? They nailed it.

## The Takeaway

If you're a parent watching your kid do things with technology that make you feel like you're from another century -- yeah, that's normal. The future showed up while we weren't looking and our kids are already fluent in it.

My son built this site. I provided the content, the Steam account, and a steady stream of cackling laughter. That's the honest truth.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go look at my own website one more time because I still can't believe it exists.
